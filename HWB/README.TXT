Brief explanation of how to use your program.
First, you can choose if you want to use BST or treasure hunter.
For the BST, what you can do is to insert the number, search the number, delete the number, print the number Inorder or Levelorder.
And just follow description in the program, you can use it easily.
For the treasure hunter, you need to input the map by file first.
You will be asked which the file is the map, just input the file name of the map (with .txt).
And then, just follow the description for the prograam to input the key, treasure and bomb.
The program will help you to find the shortest path to find the treasure.

Describe the problems you meet during the homework and how do you solve it.
	Due to so many midterm, it doesn't have so many time for me to write the homework. 
This will be the biggest problem.
	My solution is to do the first part of homework before CBT I, because BST is also a problem for BST.
In this part, the problem is the 'delete' part because it has many things need to think well.
But teacher had told the idea in the class before, so it is not so difficult.
	And then I do the second part of homework after the Probability midterm.
I think after doing the first part, the second part is more easily.
But I also do the homework to 4am, it's really tired.
And also, I think this homework is easier than the last one.
