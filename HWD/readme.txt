Describe the problems you meet during the homework and how do you solve it.
First when I saw the homework topic, I felt really scared of it, I don¡¦t know where to start it.  But when I settle down to do it, I found that it is not as difficult as I think.  What I need to do is using strtok to cut the string.  Because I don¡¦t do a lot of string working before, so I spend a little time on it.  Luckily, it have some disciplines on the string, so finally I did it success.  After analyzing the command, the homework become easier, what I need to do is only sorting.  I try to use function to function concept to do the work, it had been a long time last I use it.  By the concept, I don¡¦t need to write so much different function, I just need to write two kind of sorting algorithm.  And the final problem is double sorting, it is not so difficult to solve it, I just need to do two times sorting.  When I do the second sorting, I will look back if the first sorting result is the same.  Only when the first sorting result is the same, I can swap the second things.  And then, the topic had been solved.
